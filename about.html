        <h2>About Memory Tides</h2>
        <p>Memory Tides is a web application that allows users to geolocate their memories on a map. Users can input epub text. The application will then display the location on a map and save the memory in a database. 
        
        Exploring how to transform non-spatial data—specifically memories and text narratives—into spatial representations. 

        Memories (whether recorded in diaries, oral histories, or photographs) are inherently fuzzy and subjective. Converting them into spatial data can reveal hidden patterns and relationships that enrich the understanding of cultural heritage.
        
        The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The map is powered by Mapbox.</p>
