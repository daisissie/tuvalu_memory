        <p>In March 2025, a group of students from Columbia University traveled to Tuvalu’s capital island to document the layered realities of a vanishing landscape. From climate change’s existential threat to the quiet resilience of daily life. Among our goals was to utilize oral histories as living testaments to traditions adapting against time.
            Our first encounter began at the airport, where women sold handicrafts under the hum of propeller planes. One artisan, Viapoa, stood out. Through the help of a translator, we also met at the women’s handicraft center at the airport. We asked to learn more about her practice, which she kindly informed us about. We asked if we could meet with her another day to continue our conversation, to which she gestured toward her home. We pulled out our phones map application which had no data lines street names nothing. The islands internet resources scarce. All we had were a few loaded landmarks and the ocean and terrane to guid us. We had to utilize our memory and so did our tranlator. He pointed at a location north from where we were. We tried to utilize our limited photo memory of our two days on the island.. Between the three of us we though we would manage, translators last directio was that its location was anchored to  the Taiwanese embassy—a direction that became a pilgrimage of its own. Th next afternoodn we set out to find her. We made it to the taiwanese embassy and First, For 20 minutes, we knocked on doors, asked strangers, to no avail. Finally we though lets just go to the emapassy and verify the road name given to us. The door opened by a tieanes official who tried to help,in the background a tuvalu women emerged, we told her viapolas name and held up the fan the only representation close enough to get her to understand who we were looking for. Eyes lit up she say yes she know who we are looking for and guided us to follow her. The taiwanese official looked on stunned and bewildered by the whol situation, “ill be back shes tells him”. We  followed a girl who finally recognized Viapoa’s name. She led us up two block on her moter bike as we walked behind her a great distance. When we arrived, at viapoas door, she knocked twice, to no answer, she then opens the door yelling for viapoa, someone responds inn tuvalan to come in I assume, as she gestures us to come in. She leads us to the back of the home, anf outside area the family hangs out babies asleep in hammocks, teenagers playing games and viapoa in the corner working on a new fan weaving. She welcomed us with laughter,”come come she gesters with her hands”
             her son Vine his wife and veryone welcomes us. 
            
            Vain begins translating as best he could between Tuvaluan and his halting English.
            What unfolded was more than a weaving lesson. Viapoa and her family revealed a craft caught between generational passion and practical scarcity: shortages of materials, time, and sometimes interest, even as the work itself thrived in their hands. Vine, who once wrangled sharks but now avoids the perilous tides, confessed this was his first time witnessing his mother’s process from start to near-finish. Stories spilled out—of who taught which stitches, how colors were sourced, and the rhythms of rural versus urban life. We traded tales, our questions met with their curiosity about our worlds.
            This transcript captures that exchange exactly as it happened—stumbles, fragmented English, and all. The broken language is not a barrier but a bridge, revealing how tradition persists in the face of erasure. The fan they weave becomes a metaphor: fragile yet enduring, like an island resisting the sea.
