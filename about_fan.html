        <p>In March 2025, a group of students from Columbia University traveled to Tuvalu’s capital island to document the layered realities of the fragile landscape where climate change’s existential threat meets the quiet endurance of daily life. As students set out on their individual and group research, one of our central aims was to gather oral histories as living, breathing archives testaments to the traditions that adapt, resist, and remember in real time.

        Prior to our arrival, we had learned about the Tuvalu Women’s Handicraft Center—a hub where artisans sell their crafts to arriving and departing travelers. But it was more than a marketplace. The space thrived as a social anchor: women, girls, and youth gathered to talk, children danced to music played aloud, and infants were passed between hands as mothers slipped out to nearby stores for kaleve todi, a refreshing coconut drink. Though we didn’t know anyone by name, we hoped to meet the artisans behind these objects, to trace the stories woven into them. We stopped at each table, taking in the crafts and speaking with the artists, until we reached the end, where we found Baipua. Surrounded by fans and other handcrafted pieces, her quiet composure and warm smile drew us in.
        We struck up a conversation with Baipua through a local man we’d just met at the airport, a bystander we asked on a whim to translate. He agreed, bridging the gap between our questions and her knowledge. As Baipua explained her weaving practice, we asked if we could meet again to learn more. She didn’t give us an address, just a street name and a vague gesture toward the direction of her home.
        Out of habit, we pulled out our phones, pulled up Apple Maps and Google Maps, muscle memory from back home kicked in, where a quick search would chart the way. But reality snapped back: The screens showed only the blank expanse of sea and terrain, no street names, no data. The only anchor we had was the one Baipua and our translator offered: “Look for the Taiwanese embassy. Her home is just beside it.”
        </p>
        The next afternoon, we set out. We reached the embassy area but found ourselves lost, wandering for twenty minutes, knocking on doors, asking passersby, each time met with polite confusion. Eventually, we tried the embassy itself. A Taiwanese official opened the door, unsure how to help. Just then, a Tuvaluan woman appeared behind him. We showed her a fan, said Baipua’s name, and she lit up, she knew exactly who we were looking for. “Follow me,” she said, climbing onto her motorbike while we followed on foot for blocks.
        When we reached the house, she knocked, opened the door, and called out. A voice from inside answered in Tuvaluan, and she waved us in. We stepped into a shaded backyard where hammocks swung, children played, and in the corner, Baipua sat weaving. She looked up, laughed, and welcomed us with a smile and a gesture: “Come, come.”
        Her son, Vine, and his wife greeted us warmly, joining the conversation as Vine naturally, without request, began translating back and forth between Tuvaluan and his halting English. What followed wasn’t simply a lesson in fan weaving. It was a window into a craft suspended between generations, rooted in passion, constrained by scarcity, and made more tender by the uncertain future of the island itself. Vine, once a shark hunter who no longer ventures into the increasingly treacherous waters, admitted he had never seen his mother’s full process until that day. Stories unfurled, about who taught what, how certain colors came to be, and how rural rhythms differed from urban ones. Our questions prompted theirs.
        <p>This transcript preserves that exchange, its hesitations, overlaps, and the improvisations of translation. The broken language wasn’t a barrier but a medium. Through it, a cultural memory came alive. The fan they wove is more than an artifact; it’s a metaphor, delicate yet durable, handmade against the pressure of time. It mirrors the island itself: vulnerable, enduring, and profoundly rooted.</p>
